:computer: Client-Server Architecture is the most prominent application structure on the Internet. In this architecture, clients ( eg: personal computers, IoT devices, etc. ) first request resources from a server. Then the server sends back appropriate responses for the clientsâ€™ requests. For this to happen, there should be some mechanism implemented in both the clients and the servers which supports this network transaction. That mechanism is called socket communication.
