# Chat Server Application

**This is a simple Chat Server application that is made up of a combination of two applications, Server (which runs on the server side) and Client (which runs on the client side).
What happened here is that the server program has sent data to the client upon request and the client program has printed it out to the terminal and vice versa.**

* **Language Used:** Core Java
* **Concept Used:** Swing and Networking ([Socket Programming](https://www.javatpoint.com/socket-programming))
* **IDE Used:** IntelliJ IDEA

:computer: Client-Server Architecture is the most prominent application structure on the Internet. In this architecture, clients ( eg: personal computers, IoT devices, etc. ) first request resources from a server. Then the server sends back appropriate responses for the clients’ requests. For this to happen, there should be some mechanism implemented in both the clients and the servers which supports this network transaction. That mechanism is called socket communication.
